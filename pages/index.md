# Hi,
I'm <hl>Kumaraswamy B G</hl>, a 16 y/o programmer.<br>
I code in *Kotlin* and *Java*, but do touch some *C++* and *Python*.

Ever since I was young, I had a very keen interest towards Computers.\
I taught myself some *HTML* in 2017 when I was 8. My biggest push was in late 2019, my exams were cancelled, followed by 3 years of lockdown period.

I was fortunate enough to meet some wonderful individuals online who guided and inspired me for many years.

# Now,

In 2022, I was nominated as a community moderator at [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu) based on my contributions 
towards to the forum. Where I actively volunteer at and maintain many open 
source tools and extensions that are widely used, by students and professionals.

MIT AI(2) is a non-profit educational platform, where students can easily express their ideas by creating apps. 
Thus providing a solid foundation, before entering into more real world programming.

This is where I started too, it is an excellent place for learning and collaboration, where you can apply and practice various skills.
